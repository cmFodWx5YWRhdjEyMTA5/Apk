     <item>"EVM stands for Electronic Voting Machine. These machines have been used in the elections since 1999 paving the way for electronic voting. EVMs are used in both the General and State elections of India. For first-time users, staring at an EVM can be daunting if you do not know what to do. But for both first-time users and experienced users, knowing the working behind an EVM is important.

 Advantages of EVMs :

 ❐ EVMs reduce the time in casting votes.

 ❐ EVMs also reduce the time taken to count votes and declare results.

 ❐ Claims were made earlier that the systems could be tampered with and the security could be breached, but this has not been proved.

 ❐ EVMs save paper.

 ❐ These machines are powered by batteries and do not rely on electricity which ensures uninterrupted voting.

 ❐ EVMs can accommodate 64 candidates in a single constituency.

 ❐ Votes can be stored for up to 10 years.

 ❐ The program of EVMs cannot be changed and have a sealed security chip, therefore votes cannot be rigged without damaging the program. This prevents fraud.

 ❐ Only one vote can be cast per person as the machine will register only the first button pressed.

 ❐ EVMs restrict 5 votes for every minute.

 ❐ NOTA was introduced recently at EVMs for voters to cast their vote even if they are not in favor of any of the candidates or parties. NOTA votes are counted and indicates that the elector is not happy with any of the candidates.

 EVMs are beneficial in the following ways:

 ❐ EVMs reduce the amount of time taken to cast votes.

 ❐ Being electronic, EVMs are environment friendly as they do not use paper.

 ❐ Votes cast in EVMs can be counted faster.

 ❐ EVMs reduce chances of vote rigging thanks to their security features.

 ❐ EVMs can store votes for up to 10 years in their systems.

 Limitation :

 ❐ If your preferred language is English, then you might face a little difficulty. You should be familiar with the candidates symbol you wish to vote for. The names of the candidates will be placed alphabetically in the respective language of the state. Therefore in Maharashtra, the names appear in Marathi, in Karnataka, the names appear in Kannada, and so on.

 ❐ Each ballot unit can accommodate only 16 candidates. Therefore ballot units may be linked together to accommodate more. A total of 4 ballot units can be linked to accommodate 64 candidates from a single constituency. Any number above this will have to be added by the old manual voting method.

 ❐ EVMs can record 3840 votes. Although, this number is not much of a limitation as the number of voters at a polling station is generally lower."</item>

 ❐ The majority of the farmers are still practising the traditional methods of cultivation, resulting in low growth rates and productivity. The farmers have to be made aware of modern technologies suitable to their holdings. Providing adequate knowledge to the farmers is essential for better implementation of the agricultural development plans and to improve the productivity.

 ❐ Considering this and a very limited irrigated area, the productivity of not only rice but also other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now.

 ❐ The main crops are rice, maize, kodo-kutki and other small millets and pulses (tuar and kulthi); oilseeds, such as groundnuts (peanuts), soybeans and sunflowers, are also grown. In the mid-1990s, most of Chhattisgarh was still a monocrop belt. Only one-fourth to one-fifth of the sown area was double-cropped. When a very substantial portion of the population is dependent on agriculture, a situation where nearly 80% of a states area is covered only by one crop, immediate attention to turn them into double crop areas is needed. Also, very few cash crops are grown in Chhattisgarh, so there is a need to diversify the agriculture produce towards oilseeds and other cash crops."</item>
